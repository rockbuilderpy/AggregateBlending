## What is Aggregate Blending
Aggregate blending is the process of intermixing two or more fine or coarse aggregates to produce a combination with improved grading or other properties. ACI PRC-211.7-20 “Guide for Proportioning Concrete Mixtures with Ground Calcium Carbonate and Other Mineral Fillers” and ACI 211.6T-14 “Aggregate Suspension Mixture Proportioning Method” discuss proportioning methods that could be used to improve aggregate gradation through blending.
